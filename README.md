# SNAKE-GAME-PYTHON

This is a simple snake game in python using the pygame library.

Just use your arrow keys to play.

There are only three lives. 
As you start to play and cross the food, point increases an the speed and size of the snake increases gradually.
If the snake colides with the wall or colides on itself, then one live is lost and if there is no lives left, the game is over.

The highscore earned in the game is saved in  a file "highscore.txt".

Play and enjoy.
